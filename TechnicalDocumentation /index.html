                <p>JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML
                    document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder
                    of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.</p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is incredibly versatile. You can start small, with carousels, image galleries, fluctuating layouts, and responses
                    to button clicks. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics,
                    comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript itself is fairly compact yet very flexible. Developers have written a large variety of tools on top of the core
                    JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of extra functionality with minimum effort. These include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) — APIs built into web browsers, providing functionality like dynamically
                        creating HTML and setting CSS styles, collecting and manipulating a video stream from the user's
                        webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Third-party APIs to allow developers to incorporate functionality in their sites from other content providers, such as Twitter
                        or Facebook.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Third-party frameworks and libraries you can apply to your HTML to allow you to rapidly build up sites and applications.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Because this article is only supposed to be a light introduction to JavaScript, we are not going to confuse you at this stage
                    by talking in detail about what the difference is between the core JavaScript language and the different
                    tools listed above. You can learn all that in detail later on, in our JavaScript learning area, and in
                    the rest of MDN.

                <p>
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles
                    Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression
                    syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
                    from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on
                    a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based
                    object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
                    dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports
                    functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing
                    as loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods.
                    You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not
                    have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                    he above section might sound really exciting, and so it should — JavaScript is one of the most lively web technologies, and
                    as you start to get good at using it, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.

                    However, becoming comfortable with JavaScript is a little harder than becoming comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have
                    to start small and keep working in small consistent steps. To start, we'll show how to add some basic
                    JavaScript to your page, creating a "hello world!" example
                </p>
                <p>
                    To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                </p>
                <code>
                    function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } greetMe("World");
                </code>
                <code>
                    var myHeading = document.querySelector('h1'); myHeading.textContent = 'Hello world!';
                </code>
                <code>
                    /* Everything in between is a comment. */
                </code>
                <code>
                    // This is a comment
                </code>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="variable">
                <header class="title">variable</header>
                <p>
                    Variables are containers that you can store values in. You start by declaring a variable with the var keyword, followed by
                    any name you want to call it:
                </p>
                <code>
                    var MyVariable;
                </code>
                <p>
                    After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:
                </p>
                <code>
                    myVariable = 'Bob';
                </code>
